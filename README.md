# To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple To-Do List web application designed to help users keep track of tasks they need to accomplish. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks as needed.

## Features

- **Add Task:** Users can input a task into the text field and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
- **Edit Task:** Each task item has an "Edit" button that allows users to edit the task's text.
- **Delete Task:** Each task item has a "Delete" button that allows users to remove the task from the list.
- **LocalStorage:** Tasks are stored locally in the browser's localStorage, allowing users to revisit the page and see their tasks persist.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the web page is defined using HTML.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout are handled using CSS.
